h1. rvmify

Give each of your projects it's own RVM gemset and use Bundler to install the required gems.

Based on "this implementation":http://gist.github.com/439102 by Wayne E. Seguin

h2. Installation

gem install rvmify

h2. Usage

<pre><code>cd my_project
rvmify .
</code></pre>

Or do it with ruby:

<pre><code>Dir.glob("*").each do |dir|
  RVMify.generate(dir)
end
</code></pre>

Make sure you have the following line in the .rvmrc file in your home directory:

<pre><code>
export rvm_gemset_create_on_use_flag=1
</code></pre>

h2. Todo

* Use Thor for generators
* Figure out how to handle bundler updates
* Provide a flag to override the gemset name
* Play nice with passenger

h2. Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
